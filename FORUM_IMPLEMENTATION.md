## Known Limitations

1. **Category IDs**: Categories use array index (0, 1, 2) instead of database IDs
2. **No Pagination**: All topics/comments load at once (add pagination for large forums)
3. **No Search**: No built-in search functionality
4. **No Rich Text**: Comments are plain text only
5. **No Notifications**: No email or in-app notifications
6. **No User Profiles**: Comments use username only (no avatars)

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Topic pagination (load 20 topics per page)
- Comment pagination (load 50 comments per page)
- Search functionality (search topics by title/content)
- Markdown support for rich text
- File/image attachments
- User mentions (@username)
- Topic tags/labels
- Upvote/downvote system
- Report content feature
- Email notifications
- User activity feed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot read properties of undefined"**
- Check that database schema is installed
- Verify API routes are accessible
- Check browser console for specific errors

**"Unauthorized" errors**
- Ensure user is logged in
- Check session cookie is set
- Verify authentication is working

**Topics not appearing**
- Check category_id matches category index
- Verify topics are not deleted
- Check browser Network tab for API errors

**Moderation not working**

- Check Supabase service role key is set
- Review API response in Network tab

### Debug Steps

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for errors
3. Check Network tab for failed API calls
4. Verify Supabase tables exist
5. Check database RLS policies are correct
