# Forum System Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the complete forum system with topics, comments, and admin moderation.

## Overview

The forum system includes:
- **Forum Categories** - Configured in the admin panel
- **Topics** - Created by authenticated users within categories
- **Comments** - Posted by authenticated users on topics
- **Moderation Tools** - Admin panel for moderating content (pin, lock, delete topics and comments)

## Database Setup

### Step 1: Run the SQL Schema

1. Log into your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Open the file `docs/database/forum-schema.sql`
4. Copy and paste the entire SQL script into the Supabase SQL editor
5. Click "Run" to execute the schema

This will create:
- `forum_topics` table
- `forum_comments` table
- Indexes for performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Triggers for automatic timestamp updates

### Step 2: Verify Tables

Check that the following tables exist in your Supabase database:
- ‚úÖ `admins` (existing)
- ‚úÖ `sessions` (existing)
- ‚úÖ `site_content` (existing)
