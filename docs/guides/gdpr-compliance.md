  "confirmUsername": "username",

## Admin Considerations

### Preventing Last Admin Deletion
The system prevents the last admin account from being deleted to ensure platform access.

**How it works:**
1. Before deletion, count total admin accounts
2. If deleting user is admin and count ‚â§ 1, prevent deletion
3. Return error: "Cannot delete the last admin account. Please create another admin first."

**Best Practice:**
- Always maintain at least 2 admin accounts
- Create a backup admin before deleting your admin account
- Use the Users tab in admin panel to create additional admins

### Data Cleanup
When a user deletes their account:
- Avatar images in Supabase Storage are automatically deleted
- Database records are removed
- Sessions are invalidated
- No manual cleanup required

## Troubleshooting

**"Cannot delete the last admin account"**
- Create another admin user first
- Go to `/admin` ‚Üí Users tab
- Create a new user with "admin" role
- Then retry deletion

**Export fails with 401 error**
- Ensure you're logged in
- Check session hasn't expired
- Try logging out and back in

**Deletion fails with "Username does not match"**
- Username is case-sensitive
- Must match exactly
- Check for extra spaces

**Avatar not deleted from storage**
- Check Supabase Storage manually
- The API attempts deletion but continues even if it fails
- This is a non-critical error
